Can you imagine a future where novels, news articles, and comedy were written by a program? This course will introduce students to text generation from the field of natural language processing in which we will discuss the methods, their applications and ethical implications. The class will include hands-on interaction with new technology to aid in the understanding of its capabilities and limitations.
